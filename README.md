# WRTDigger.py

This is a small script (64 lines of actual code) that checks whether Cisco Linksys is using the default 'admin:admin' credentials. 

Simply edit line 88 to reflect the IP range you want to scan, and run it without parameters. If you would like to scan only one IP, use a single range; example: 192.168.0.254-254.
